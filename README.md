# Chicagos-Traffic-Crashes-Analyzed
# Traffic Crash Data Analysis with Pandas, Python, Matplotlib, and Google Colab. 

This repository provides a step-by-step tutorial on performing data analysis using a real-world dataset of traffic crashes. We'll leverage the power of Python's pandas library for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and Google Colab for an interactive coding environment. 

## Project Overview

This tutorial walks you through the process of:
- Loading a large CSV dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Initial data inspection and handling common issues like mixed data types.
- Extracting meaningful information, such as crash counts by year.
- Visualizing data trends using Matplotlib to gain insights.
- Identifying missing values across the dataset.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Google Colab**: A cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and offers free access to computing resources.

## Dataset

The data used in this tutorial is the "Traffic Crashes - Crashes" dataset, which is publicly available. You can download the latest version of this dataset from the City of Chicago's data portal:

[Download Traffic Crashes - Crashes Dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Traffic-Crashes-Crashes/85ca-t3if/about_data)

### How to get the data:
1. Visit the link above.
2. Look for the 'Export' or 'Download' options on the dataset page.
3. Download the data in CSV format.
4. If you're using Google Colab, upload the `.csv` file to your Google Drive and ensure you mount your Drive in Colab to access it (as demonstrated in the code).

## How to Use This Tutorial

1.  **Clone this repository** to your local machine or open it directly in Google Colab.
2.  **Download the dataset** as instructed above and place it where your Colab notebook can access it (e.g., your Google Drive).
3.  **Follow the code cells sequentially**: Each code cell is designed to build upon the previous one, guiding you through the data analysis process.
4.  **Experiment**: Feel free to modify the code, try different analyses, and explore other aspects of the dataset!

Let's get started with understanding traffic patterns!
